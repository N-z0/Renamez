 - Have been tested mostly on Linux system but may operate on others compatible platforms.  
 - But it's not guaranteed without bugs and any futures improvements are not sure.  
 - Length restriction of names and extensions may vary depending on the operating system:  
	 - 8 characters for the name and 3 for the extension under DOS and Windows 3.1  
	 - 256 characters for name and extension under Windows 95, 98 and NT  
	 - 256 characters as well on Unix systems  
 - dots are extension markers, it can cause bug if a name includes a series of dots.  
	(currently this program not consider names with a prefix dot for hiding)  
 - There is no minimum restriction on numbers of extensions.  
	Names with less or no extension are considered correct even if maximum ext parameter is set higher.
